# Dictionaries-2
Dictionaries are ordered collection of data items; they store multiple items in a single variable; and dictionary items are key-value pairs that are separated by commas and enclosed within {} brackets. This repo includes basic python codes of dictionaries - creating them, accessing them, add/update, remove some item, iteration, and nested dict.
